## Description
We have created a fitness tracker that allows a user to track their workouts and share workouts with their fitness community. 

## User Story
AS a user I want to be able to track my workouts
SO I stay motivated to continue my fitness journey
AS a user I want to view what other workouts people are doing
SO I learn new workouts to shake up my fitness routine


## Features
* This application was created with a combination of the following:
    * HTML
    * CSS
    * MySQL
    * JavaScript
    * BootStrap CSS Framework
    * Handlebars Templating Engine
    * Express.js
    * Node.js
    * Bcrypt
    * Sessions
    * Sequelize
* A user can create an account if they don't have one already
* A user can login to their account if they have one
* A user can view their logged workouts on their 'My Workouts' dashboard
* A user can create a workout
* A user can view other users logged workouts on the 'Community Workouts' Feed.

## Future Development
* Add more exercises
* Planned vs actual workout results
* Random workout generator
    * From history (something you know, something new, something you haven’t done in a while, something your friends have done)
* A feature allowing users to follow each other and favorite (“friend”) other users
* Homepage with example workouts (“Upper Body Day”, “Full-Body Workout”, "Leg Day", "Cardio")
* Short clip showing how to perform exercise
* Exercise tags for effort (beginner, advanced, multiple muscle groups)
